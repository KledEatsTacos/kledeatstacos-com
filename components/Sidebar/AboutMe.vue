          Introducing myself is always a challenge, but here's a brief glimpse
          into who I am: I'm a software engineer, constantly learning and
          passionate about building my future with zeros and ones. I'm
          {{ store.age }}
          years old, born and raised in Turkey.
        </span>

        <p>
          In terms of appearance, I'm of average height and slightly leaner than
          most. You'll usually find me sporting short hair and a beard, and on
          sunny days, I'll have sunglasses on due to an eye issueâ€”those sun rays
          are no friend of mine.
        </p>

        <p>
          My love for computer technologies, software, and video games dates back
          to my childhood, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in software
          engineering. While I may not be the most social person, those close to
          me know that I can be quite chatty when discussing topics I'm passionate
          about. ^_^
        </p>

        <p>
          As for my inner world, others have described me as intelligent,
          sophisticated, cultured, dignified, gentle, calm, and humble. While I
          appreciate these positive qualities, I'm more focused on doing what's
          right rather than being perceived as good or bad.
        </p>

        <span>
          I hope this brief introduction gives you a glimpse into who I am. Thank
          you for taking the time to get to know me. Take care and stay safe!
