      <span>
        I donâ€™t know how to start introducing myself. I can briefly say that Iâ€™m an always-learner software engineer
        who
        wants to build his future with zeros and ones. Iâ€™m 27 years old and Iâ€™ve been living in Turkey since I was born,
        which makes me a Turk naturally. Anyway, let me tell you a little bit of my physical appearance. Iâ€™ve got a
        normal
        height and slightly weaker weight than usual. Usually, Iâ€™m getting around with short hair and a beard. If itâ€™s a
        sunny day, youâ€™ll see me wearing sunglasses because Iâ€™ve got an issue in my eyes. Those damn sun rays, I hate
        them.

        I have loved computer technologies, softwares, and of course, video games since my childhood. Perhaps, this is
        the
        biggest reason I chose the profession in software engineering today. (Yeah, definitely it is ðŸ™‚) There is no
        doubt, Iâ€™m not an extremely social person because in general Iâ€™m not a talkative fellow. But there is an
        exception. If there are people I love or is something I can talk about, I can be a chatty guy ^_^

        Well, whatâ€™s happening in my inner world? Letâ€™s take a quick look at whatâ€™s going on over there. Intelligent,
        sophisticated, cultured, dignified, gentle, calm, and humble. These are some words that other people say about
        me.
        Mostly theyâ€™re saying positive based words about me. I think Iâ€™m a good fellow ðŸ˜…. But I donâ€™t care so much
        about
        whether Iâ€™m good or bad. Iâ€™m just trying to do the right thing, not the good one. Thatâ€™s my lifelong goal and
        source of my motivation. I tried to introduce myself to you because I wanted that. Itâ€™s a little selfish, isnâ€™t
        it? I hope I succeeded. Take safe care of yourself and have fun. Farewell!
